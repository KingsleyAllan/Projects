        It's not about "tuning" or "dressing up."<br>
        Nowadays,<br>
        there is a fancy word "custom", but it is a little different.<br><br>

        "Modding".<br>
        That's the perfect way to describe our style.<br><br>

        Removing bumpers, transplanting headlights of different models, and installing over fenders,<br><br>

        so-called highway racers of the Showa era.<br>
        Japan one of the ancient custom car cultures,<br>
        let's do a "runaway style" that clearly divides likes and dislikes based on<br>
        high-end cars!<br><br>
